[![Module 0 of Campus Advisors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1874003/36122591-ea91f676-1017-11e8-89f6-c1d71a51d5e5.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51LQJbGeOQo&feature=youtu.be)

1. Register for an account on [github.com](https://github.com/). You’ll use GitHub for hands-on activities. 
2. [Download, install and configure git](https://git-scm.com/). (For Windows folks, [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) is recommended).
3. If you are new to Git, GitHub, and the command-line, I recommend [downloading ATOM](https://atom.io/), a text editor, which is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows. I will be using ATOM in all of the modules.

    - If you are using a Chromebook, great news! You can use ATOM to follow along with the videos with some easy instructions:

        - [Instructions and setup for ATOM for Chromebook Users](https://blog.atom.io/2018/10/02/running-atom-on-chome-os.html)
    
    - If you are using Windows, and new to the command-line, I would recommend following additional instructions to avoid using the default shell, known as "PowerShell," in ATOM since all of the examples in the modules will be using a Unix based shell:

3. [Education.github.community](https://education.github.community/): We’re using these forums as our learning management system (LMS). You’ll accept and post assignments in the Campus Advisors section of the community.
