# Module-0-Welcome

## To Get Started

[![Module 0 of Campus Advisors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1874003/36122591-ea91f676-1017-11e8-89f6-c1d71a51d5e5.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51LQJbGeOQo&feature=youtu.be)

1. Register for an account on [github.com](https://github.com/). You’ll use GitHub for hands-on activities. 
2. [Download, install and configure git](https://git-scm.com/). Windows users please install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).
3. If you are new to Git, GitHub, and the command-line, I recommend [downloading ATOM](https://atom.io/), a text editor, which is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows. I will be using ATOM in all of the modules.

    #### Mac and Linux Setup
      If you are using a Mac or Linux machine, I would recommend following these instructions to setup the ATOM command-line:
      - [Instructions and setup for using ATOM in Windows]()

    #### Chromebook User Setup
      If you are using a Chromebook, great news! You can use ATOM to follow along with the videos with some easy instructions:
      - [Instructions and setup for ATOM for Chromebook Users](https://blog.atom.io/2018/10/02/running-atom-on-chome-os.html)
      - [ATOM command-line Instructions]()

    #### Windows User Setup
      If you are using Windows, and new to the command-line, I would recommend following additional instructions to avoid using the default shell, known as "PowerShell," in ATOM since all of the examples in the modules will be using a Unix based shell:

4. Make sure to set Git with your name and email address using the following commands on the command-line with your name and email address:
```
$ git config --global user.name "FirstName LastName"
$ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
```
This is important because Git will use this information when you work on a project.

5. [Education.github.community](https://education.github.community/): We’re using these forums as our learning management system (LMS). You’ll accept and post assignments in the Campus Advisors section of the community.
