1. Register for an account on [github.com](https://github.com/). You’ll use GitHub for hands-on activities. 
2. [Download, install and configure git](https://git-scm.com/). (For Windows folks, [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) is recommended).  In your terminal, configure Git to recognize you:
`git config user.name “First Last"`
`git config --global user.email "email@example.com"`
3. [Education.github.community](https://education.github.community/): We’re using these forums as our learning management system (LMS). You’ll accept and post assignments in the Campus Advisors section of the community.
4. Meet [Chris](https://github.com/ccannon94)!
    - Chris will be the TA for our training! He will be assisting with issues you may run into through the forums and with your pull requests (when we get there).
    - Chris is a senior studying Computer Engineering at North Carolina A&T State University, where he is also an undergraduate TA with the Computer Science department.
    - Also, Chris is a GitHub Campus Expert, the student program for GitHub Education.
    - You can get Chris's help by posting a new topic in the Campus Advisors section of the GitHub Education Community.
